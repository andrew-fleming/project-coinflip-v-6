<h1>Project Coinflip</h1>
<br>
Project Coinflip utilizes Ethereum smart contracts and a front-end built in React which culminates into a betting dApp. Part of the complexity herein lies in the random number problem in blockchain. This dApp fetches a random number by sending a call to the Provable (formerly Oraclize) oracle and waiting for a callback which holds the "random number"--randomized by Provable--that can also be confirmed by the network.
